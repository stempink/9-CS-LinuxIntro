<li>Typing commands in the terminal leads to the result being shown on the terminal window. It doesn't have to be this way, though. We could redirect the output to somewhere else instead.
</li>
<li>In the 1970's, users may have wanted to output to a line printer instead.
</li>
<li>This doesn't tend to come up much in the 21st century, but you might want to put the output from the computer into a file, though.

echo "This is some text"

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>echo</code> simply prints some text to the display.
</li>
<li>By itself, this isn't very useful. We can use this to create and add content to text files, though.

echo "This is some text." &gt; whatsit.txt

<li>If you look, you'll see you just created a new file.
</li>
<li>If you do <code>cat whatsit.txt</code> or <code>emacs whatsit.txt</code> or even nano <code>whatsit.txt</code> you'll see the contents of the file.
</li>
<li>The redirect symbol <code>&gt;</code> tells Linux to put the result of whatever command comes before it into a new file. Unfortunately, this means over-writing the contents of the first <code>echo</code> command we did.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To be a proper Linux pro, you'll want to start using pipes.
</li>
<li>The basic idea is that you run a program, then pass the results to another program (and maybe another and another&#x2026;)
</li>
<li>Being able to do this makes Linux incredibly powerful, especially if you're quite creative.
</li>
<li>Let's try an example: You're running out of space on your computer, and you want to know which files are taking up the most room so you can delete them.
</li>
<li>The <code>du</code> command tells you how much disk space every file and sub-directory is using from wherever you are on the computer.
</li>
<li>If you're in <code>/</code> (the root) when you start, you'll see the details for <b>EVERY</b> file on the computer. This might take a while to run, though&#x2026; 
</li>
<li>Change into a directory with a few files in it (like your 'My Documents' directory, and give it a go. You can always hit Ctrl-c to kill the program if it takes too long.
</li>
<li>By itself, this command gives an overwhelming amount of information, presented in ascending (smallest to largest) order.
</li>
<li>The pipe symbol ( <code>|</code> ) takes the output from one program, and sends it into another. You can chain lots of these together to achieve sophisticated results.
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>sort</code> command takes any file and sorts it into either asecending or descending order. By putting <code>-nr</code> on the end of the command, we ask the <code>sort</code> program to use numeric values (<code>n</code>) and reverse (<code>r</code>) the sort order. 
</li>
<li>In our quest to find the largest files on the system, at least they'll appear in the right order now, although there are likely to be millions of files.
</li>
<li>Try it: 
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="example">
cd /
du | sort -nr
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This time, there will be a bit of a delay while the computer browses the files available and sorts them, then your enormous list of files will be output. 
</li>
<li>Finally, we can take this output and just ask to see the first 10 results by piping the output through <code>head</code>&#x2026;
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="example">
du | sort -nr | head
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>These filesizes are all in bytes. If we add a <code>-h</code> after the <code>du</code> command, it'll be presented in a human-readable format (i.e. showing files in kilbytes, megabytes and so on). 
</li>
<li>Many Linux command-line programs can be given parameters like this to modify how they work. 
</li>
<li>Linux has a built in manual that you can use to find out more about any command you're using. Type <code>man more</code> for instance, to see more information avout the <code>more</code> command. 
</li>
<li>When browsing <code>man</code> pages, use the space bar to move forward a whole page, or the up/down arrows to move one line at a time. Tap <code>q</code> to quit.
