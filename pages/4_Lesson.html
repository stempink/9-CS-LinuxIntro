<li>When on a computer system, users will need to be able to edit files. 
</li>
<li>Most files contain plain text with no images of video embedded in them (e.g. HTML files, .txt files, .py files). These can be modified by programs called text editors.
</li>
<li>There are various text editors available on Linux systems, and hackers typically have <a href="https://stallman.org/saint.html">strong feelings</a> about their favourite. 
</li>
<li>Some examples are:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nano
</li>
<li>vim
</li>
<li>emacs (always with a lower case e)
</li>
<li>gedit
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Internet community is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">divided</a> as to whether emacs or vim is better.
</li>
<li>You can make your own mind up on this. We use emacs to author everything you see on <a href="https://www.bournetocode.com">BourneToCode.com</a> and <a href="https://www.bournetoinvent.com">BourneToInvent.com</a> though. 
</li>
<li>Although originally written for UNIX-like systems, most of the above editors are also availale for other operating systems, like Windows.

<li>emacs was written for an era in computer science where the keyboard was the only way to enter commands onto a computer and graphics consisted of text appearing on a text-only terminal. 
</li>
<li>While superficially, it might seem daunting to enter text without a mouse, but many professional developers find that when one works without ever having to take their hands off the keyboard, they are able to work far more quickly. 
</li>
<li>In emacs, shortcuts are either achieved by holding the Control key and pressing another key, or holding the meta key (Alt) and tapping another key. 
</li>
<li>The shorthand for this looks like this: <code>C-x C-f</code>.
</li>
<li>This would mean to Hold Control and tap <code>x</code>, then to hold Control and tap <code>f</code>. You don't need to release the control key each time, but you can if you want to.
</li>
<li><code>M-f</code> means to hold the Alt key and tap the f key. 
</li>
<li><i>Factoid:</i> Instead of holding Alt, you could hit <code>Esc</code> once then tap the <code>f</code>, just like in the 1980s.

<li>We can't connect to it with the pop-up JavaScript emulator you've used in the previous sessions, so start by double-clicking the "Ubuntu" icon on your Windows desktop.
</li>
<li>Once the session has started, log in with your standard network username and password.
</li>
<li><b>Note:</b> As you type your password, you won't see anything. This is normal; just don't look at the screen and you won't notice.
</li>
<li>When logged in, type <code>startx</code> to get a more attractive interface. You'll need to log in to this too.
</li>
<li>When on the Ubuntu desktop, click the 'Activities' link in the top-left corner or the screen and type <code>Terminal</code> to load up a the command line so we can get started.

<li>One of the great things about using Linux is the ability to work on other machines around the World easily. This is often achieved using a program called SSH, short for 'secure shell'. It's remarkably easy to connect to another computer.
</li>
<li>In the terminal window, type:
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="example">
ssh 00zz11@studentweb
</pre>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Replace the <code>00zz11</code> with your network username.
</li>
<li>After a moment, you'll be asked for your password again.
</li>
<li>If you type it correctly, you'll have a new terminal prompt, along the lines of:
</li>
<li><code>00zz11@brgrastudentweb:~/</code>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>00zz11</code> lets you know who you're logged in as.
</li>
<li>The <code>@brgrastudentweb</code> tells you the name of the server you're connected to.
</li>
<li><code>~/</code> tells you that you're in your 'home' directory (~ is used as shorthand)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you type <code>ls</code>, you'll see that there is one file and one directory available to you.
</li>
<li>Use <code>cd</code> to change into the <code>www</code> directory.
</li>
<li>Anything you put in here can be seen by any other student or staff member. It's not visible from outside School; this is known as an Intranet.
</li>
<li>The address for your published content will be: <a href="http://studentweb/~yourusername">http://studentweb/~yourusername</a>
</li>
<li><b>Note:</b> Everything you do on this computer is logged, and everything can be traced back to you. You are solely responsible for what is published in your Intranet space. Do not publish anything onto the pages that you would not be happy for your parents and/or the Headteacher to see, and do not publish images of other people without their permission. Do not publish remarks about other students or staff, anything hateful, use the service to do anything illegal or publish anything likely to cause offence. Any content can be removed at any time without notice.

<li>Use the arrow keys to the section that says, 'this page is under construction' and change the text to say something else.

<li>Save the work with <code>C-x, C-s</code>.
</li>
<li>Quit out of emacs using <code>C-x, C-c</code>.
</li>
<li>Load the Firefox web browser (Look in 'Activities' in the top-left again) and view your page on the Intranet. Try some of your friends pages too.  
</li>
<li>For a taste of the 1970s, you can also use a terminal web browser called 'lynx' to browse the web. Type things liks <code>lynx google.co.uk</code> to get started, and type <code>q</code> to quit when done.
</li>
<li><b>Task:</b> Try opening your file again, changing the file a little and saving it without looking at your notes.
